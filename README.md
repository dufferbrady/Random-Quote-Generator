# Random-Quote-Generator
An app built as part of the FreeCodeCamp (FCC)intermediate projects

## Overview
The purpose of this app is that a user may click a button and be given a random quote. The reference of these quotes are entirely random and can range from a wide range of topics i.e. inspirational, historical, literature etc. The authors of these quotes are by and large included however, occasionally a quote may be retured with an unknown author, this is not an error/bug of the app but rather the information returned by the API. As part of the FCC front end development certificate this project must be completed with certain objectives met in order for the project to be deemed successful. The objectives of the project are as follows;

* One can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* One can press a button to tweet out a quote.
